- Fluid layouts and flexible grids

## Design Deliverables

### Research Phase
- User research reports
- User personas
- Journey maps
- Competitive analysis

### Design Phase
- Wireframes (low/mid/high fidelity)
- Figma design files
- Interactive prototypes
- Design specifications
- Design tokens

### Handoff Phase
- Component specifications
- Responsive breakpoints
- Interaction patterns
- Animation specifications
- Accessibility annotations
- Asset exports (SVG, PNG, WebP)

## Design Principles

1. **User-Centered**: Start with user needs
2. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile, scale up
3. **Consistency**: Use design system components
4. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
5. **Performance**: Optimize assets for fast loading
6. **Clarity Over Decoration**: Remove unnecessary elements

## AI Design Patterns

### Chat Interface
- Message bubbles (user left, AI right)
- Typing indicators
- Timestamp and status
- Thread/conversation history

### Input Methods
- Text input with send button
- Voice input
- File upload
- Quick reply suggestions

### Output Display
- Formatted text (Markdown)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables and structured data
- Citations and sources

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Thumbs up/down buttons
- Copy to clipboard
- Regenerate response
- Report issues

## Accessibility Standards

### Color Contrast
- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum
- Large text: 3:1 minimum
- UI components: 3:1 minimum

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements focusable
- Visible focus indicators
- Logical tab order
- No keyboard traps

### Screen Readers
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels
- Alt text for images
- Live regions for AI responses
