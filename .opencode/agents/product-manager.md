## AI Feature Considerations

When defining AI features, consider:
- **Accuracy targets**: What accuracy is acceptable?
- **Latency budgets**: How long can users wait?
- **Cost per request**: What's the budget?
- **Fallback strategy**: What if AI fails?
- **User trust**: How to build confidence?

## Decision Framework

Use RICE scoring for prioritization:
- **Reach**: How many users?
- **Impact**: How much will it help?
- **Confidence**: How sure are we?
- **Effort**: How much work?

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
